# Indicators

These indicators are used to judge the progress of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) (as well as non-CERP restoration projects) toward achieving restoration goals. Indicators are based on the maximum estimated counts of nesting pairs. These counts are coordinated across groups working in Loxahatchee NWR (aka WCA 1), Water Conservation Areas 2 and 3, and Everglades National Park. They have been compiled from many sources, including monitoring efforts conducted by Everglades National Park and Peter Frederick's work compiling historical and recent wading bird data.

### Max Counts
These are the yearly reported maximum observed number of nesting pairs. These counts are used to calculate 4 other indicators of restoration progress, including the ratio of tactile/sight foraging species, calculated as (whib + wost)/greg. Reported values for the other 3 indicators are provided here.

* year
* region - Loxahatchee NWR, Water Conservation areas 2 and 3, Everglades National Park
* species - see [species table](../SiteandMethods/species_list.csv)
* count - Max estimate of nesting pairs

Max_count_all.csv is also provided to record the reported number of nesting pairs across all regions (in most cases, equivalent to sums of numbers in max_count.csv).

### Coastal Nesting
Proportion of all species nesting in coastal Everglades National Park colonies, as opposed to the sawgrass Everglades. The data for this calculation only include numbers reported in the South Florida Wading Bird report. Florida Bay is not included.

### Stork Initiation Date

This is the earliest nesting initiation date for the everglades region, which includes mainland Everglades National Park and the Water Conservation Areas. Historical records (1953-1973) from Kushlan et al 1975. Recent records (1997-2024) from UF or ENP survey efforts and double checked using either field notes or South Florida Wading Bird Report. Region where earliest nesting occurred was added by M. Ernest in March 2025 using field notes and the South Florida Wading Bird Report. Corrections to 1953-1973 data were made by M. Ernest in March 2025 upon review of Kushlan et al 1975. 

Earliest nesting date for Wood Storks each year, across all colonies. Before 2010, only a month and score were recorded. Score indicates how early/late in the month nesting began:

|month|score for middle of the month|
