After ground surveys are complete, data are compiled and cleaned to provide counts and locations of islands within the survey area where nesting birds were present. Notes and GPS coordinates are reviewed and colonies that were counted but were actually outside of the transects are removed. Counts of any nests or chicks that are incidentally observed are recorded during field surveys are not tallied or included in groundcounts.csv. As with all counts generated by this project, more nests may be present than birds observed, therefore all ground counts represent the minimum possible number of nests present.
