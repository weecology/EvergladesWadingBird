Determining nest success is a science that has changed significantly over the course of the study. It is affected by our ability to detect nests and by observers' personal impressions.

Older nest success numbers are not repeatable using modern calculation methods. Codifying nest success calculations algorithmically is a goal for this project, at which point raw data will be used to standardize calculations. Until then, comparisons of older and newer nest success estimates should be conducted with care.
