Hydrological monitoring is conducted by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The SFWMD's hydrological monitoring program includes the collection of water level, stage, and discharge data from various locations throughout the Everglades.
Data provided here has been downloaded from the Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN, http://sofia.usgs.gov/eden) database.

Water depth data are available from the [Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN)](http://sofia.usgs.gov/eden), via their [EDEN THREDDS server](http://sflthredds.er.usgs.gov/) or the [Explore and View EDEN (EVE) web application](https://sofia.usgs.gov/eden/eve/). We also have created the [edenR package](https://github.com/weecology/edenR) to streamline downloads, data processing, and statistics for forecasting.
