Data from the Everglades breeding bird monitoring project

Detailed descriptions of individual data components are located in README.md files in the individual data folders. Please see the [methods](https://everglades-wading-bird-data.netlify.app/) for details about collection and how to use the data.

Water depth is crucial to wading bird behavior. Water depth data are available from the [Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN)](http://sofia.usgs.gov/eden), via their [EDEN THREDDS server](http://sflthredds.er.usgs.gov/) or the [Explore and View EDEN (EVE) web application](https://sofia.usgs.gov/eden/eve/). We also have created the [edenR package](https://github.com/weecology/edenR) to streamline downloads, data processing, and statistics for forecasting.

Additional data to complement the wading bird data can be found at [South Florida Water Management District](https://www.sfwmd.gov/) and [Florida Coastal Everglades LTER](http://fcelter.fiu.edu/).

### Data Organization
------------
    |-- Counts              <- Time series of count data from aerial and UAV images, and ground transects
    |-- DataCleaningScripts <- Scripts used to add new data
    |-- Hg                  <- Time series of feather mercury content
    |-- Historic            <- Pre-1986 data, or outside data sources
    |-- Indicators          <- Time series of indicators used in restoration assessment
    |-- Methods             <- Data paper wiki outlining detailed methods
    |-- Nesting             <- Time series of nest checks and nest success
    |-- SiteandMethods      <- Site details, site-level data tables
    |-- Weather             <- Weather station data (from NOAA)
