# Nesting Data

Please see the [methods](../SiteandMethods/methods.md) for details about collection and how to use the data.

### Nest Checks

year

colony

nest - nest id

species

date

eggs - number of eggs

chicks - number of chicks

stage - nesting stage

notes

### Nest Success

We use the Mayfield method to calculate nest success. The nest-level metrics required for calculations are stored in this table. See the [metadata](../Nesting/nest_success_metadata.csv) for data details.

### Nest Success Summary

This is colony-level nest success, based on the data from the [nest_success table](../Nesting/nest_success.csv). Success is summarized for the incubation stage, nestling stage, and overall for the whole nesting period.

k - total number of nests

sumy - total number of nests that hatched (s(i))

e - total number of days monitored (n(i))

p - 1-((k-sumy)/e), success

j - incubation or nestling period, in days (constant by species, can be found in the [species table](../SiteandMethods/species.csv))

pj - p\^j, hatch success

varp - (p\*(1-p))/e, variation of p

varpj - varp\*((j\*(p\^(j-1)))\^2), variation of pj

sdp - standard deviation of p

sdpj - standard deviation of pj
