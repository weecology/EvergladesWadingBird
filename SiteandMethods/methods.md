# University of Florida South Florida Wading Bird Study

Wading birds are of special interest with regard to the restoration of the Everglades and are considered a measure of the overall health of the ecosystem.  Nest colony formation, location, site fidelity, nest timing, total numbers of nesting pairs, and yearly variation all give important clues to the effectiveness of Everglades restoration activities.  This research provides systematic monitoring of nesting activity in the Water Conservation Areas for the endangered Wood Stork and others species. It is conducted in conjunction with similar monitoring efforts elsewhere in South Florida and part of a long-term MAPS monitoring effort.

### Habitat
Aerial surveys are conducted over all of WCA 1 (145,920 acres), 2 (133,120 acres) and 3 (563,200 acres).  See [colonies](../SiteandMethods/colonies.csv) for locations. 
Habitat is Freshwater Everglades, ranging from cypress dominated  to open sawgrass with tree islands. The Central Everglades haave an extremely low elevation gradient. Soils vary from peat dominated to marl dominated to rocky limestone outcrops. The climate is subtropical, with a marked wet/dry monsoonal system.

### Sampling design	
In the middle of each month from February through June, we perform air surveys on established E-W transects, 1.6 nm apart, over the whole of WCAs 1 (Lox), 2, and 3. Two observers, one on each side of a Cessna 172 flying 800ft AGL, searched for colonies, make visual count estimates (primarily of white waders), and take digital photographs for additional review. 

Permanent plots	many of the colonies are used repeatedly over the years but the area surveyed is constant, including all of WCAs 1, 2, and 3. 
When ground checks are conducted to better establish species composition or timing/success of nests, visits to colonies are in the mornings or evenings, and for no more than one hour per visit, to minimize heat stress on eggs and young.  Nests are checked with mirror poles.
Navigation along transects conducted by pilot-operated aviation-grade GPS receivers.  Camera used for digital aerial photographs: Canon EOS 20D, 8.2 megapixel, digital SLR.  Camera lens: Canon EF (electronic focus) 28-135mm 1:3.5-5.6 IS (image stabilizer).  Software used of photo analyses: Adobe Photoshop 2.0.


### Counts

#### Max counts
These are estimates of maximum nest counts based on a combination of observations and surveys, including aerial estimates made by both UF and SFWMD, aerial photo analysis, and ground surveys conducted by airboat. In most cases, only the date of the max count is reported. Previous lower counts are often not recorded, and if photos were taken after numbers clearly began to decrease, those photos were not countted. For most colonies, reported estimates in the [maxcount](../Counts/maxcount.csv) table are the peak count for each species as determined from aerial photographs (taken from either fixed-wing (aerial) or UAV). When counting photos, areas with no nesting birds are ignored. Thus, 'roosting' numbers represent only roosting birds in nesting areas, not total roosting birds. Because some nests within each colony are obscured by vegetation, the figures reported here are minimums. For those colonies where we established nest-check transects, estimates of dark-colored species were modified by on-site observations and by extrapolating from ratios of their nest numbers relative to the more visible GREG nests. For the largest colonies, several waves of nesting may occur, and a combination of stage of nesting, species, and ground observations were used to piece together the most likely number of nest starts at any given colony.

### Nesting

#### Nest counts
As part of a long-term monitoring strategy, we conducted weekly nest checks in a number of major colonies 
within the Everglades system through the breeding season (February - June).  
Transects are set up through colonies and individual nests are marked and revisited weekly to determine 
fate of nest. Visits to colonies are in the mornings or evenings, and for no more than one hour per visit, to minimize heat stress on eggs and young. Nest checks are conducted using mirror poles and numbered flagging to mark and recheck nests.  GPS units are used to mark the initial trail so it can be re-found for each visit.
Only young little blue herons are readily visible from the air.  When these colonies were found, nest numbers were based on an assumed 1.5 young per nest.

#### Nest success
Nest success is calculated from nest counts using the Mayfield Method. 
This determines the probability of at least one chick surviving until fledgling 
(21 days for GREG and BCNH. 14d for WHIB and SMHE, and 55d for WOST)

### Feather Mercury
Mercury is a heavy metal that has no known biological function in any organism.
It is therefore not a trace element, and a contaminant at any level. Its detrimental
effects on wildlife at high doses have been known for some time (severe neuronal
degeneration, powerful developmental effects) but the effects at low levels are only just
being discovered, particularly in wild populations of fish and birds (reproductive failure,
endocrine disruption, loss of appetite, increased susceptibility to disease, and others).

We sample feathers from Great Egret chicks – these animals feed almost
exclusively on fish, they are relatively high in the trophic web, they nest reliably from
year to year, and typically nest throughout the study area.
