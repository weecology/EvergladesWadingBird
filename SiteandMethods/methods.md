# University of Florida South Florida Wading Bird Study

### Nesting
Wading birds are of special interest with regard to the restoration of the Everglades and are considered a measure of the overall health of the ecosystem.  Nest colony formation, location, site fidelity, nest timing, total numbers of nesting pairs, and yearly variation all give important clues to the effectiveness of Everglades restoration activities.  This research provides systematic monitoring of nesting activity in the Water Conservation Areas for the endangered Wood Stork and others species. It is conducted in conjunction with similar monitoring efforts elsewhere in South Florida and part of a long-term MAPS monitoring effort.

#### Nest counts
As part of a long-term monitoring strategy, we conducted weekly nest checks in a number of major colonies 
within the Everglades system through the breeding season (February - June).  
Transects are set up through colonies and individual nests are marked and revisited weekly to determine 
fate of nest. Visits to colonies are in the mornings or evenings, and for no more than one hour per visit, to minimize heat stress on eggs and young. Nest checks are conducteed using mirror poles and numbered flagging to mark and recheck nests.  GPS units are used to mark the initial trail so it can be refound for each visit.

#### Nest success
Nest success is calculated from nest counts using the Mayfield Method. 
This determines the probability of at least one chick surviving until fledgling 
(21 days for GREG and BCNH. 14d for WHIB and SMHE, and 55d for WOST)
